## Car Price Prediction Using Logistic Regression and SVM [Numerical Dataset]

- machine learning project that aims to predict the price of a car based on a set of input features implemented in Python.
- The dataset used in this project contains information about various cars, including their make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and other features.
This data is preprocessed to ensure that it is clean and standardized before being used in the machine learning models.
- Model 1 -> Logistic regression with accuracy 92%
- Model 2 -> SVM accuracy with 92.8%
